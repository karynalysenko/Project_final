This repository doesn't contain the original data folder. This folder should contain folders of complete genomes of phages. To acquire this data go to: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome


This repository has 4 folders. Each corresponds to each explored bioinformatic tool, where in the PHACTS and PhageAI there are also the results of the performed runs. On the other hand, PhageLeads folder contains a script and a .csv file, where the script doesn't perform all the functionalities of the tool (only online version allows to use all the functionalities) and the .csv file contains information from manual runs of some genomes that were identified as temperate in PhaTYP and PhageAI.
