This repository contains the original data folder. It has folders of complete genomes of phages. Acquired data from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome


This repository has 4 folders. Each corresponds to each explored bioinformatic tool, where in the PHACTS and PhageAI there are also the results of the performed runs. On the other hand, PhageLeads folder contains a script and a .csv file, where the script doesn't perform all the functionalities of the tool (only online version allows to use all the functionalities) and the .csv file contains information from manual runs of some genomes that were identified as temperate in PhaTYP and PhageAI.

Also, the script "phageai-phatyp_report.py" is an automative script of analysis of PhageAI and PhaTYP results (usage of pandas). File "temperate_phageai_phatyp.csv" is one of the outputs of the automated scrip.
